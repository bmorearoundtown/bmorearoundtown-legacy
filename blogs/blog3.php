I want to open by saying this article will not contain the words "Ray" or "Rice" so if that's what you're looking for, you've came to the wrong place! <strong>IT'S STEELERS WEEK!!</strong> It's the time for googling "ugly things in Pittsburgh" and sending those pictures to those annoying people you work with who talk about how great their team was before they were even born. Why don't Steelers fans change burnt out light bulbs? They like to talk about how good the old one was.

		<h4><u>Week 2: Steelers (1-0) @ Ravens (0-1)</u></h4>

The Ravens are coming off a "mediocre-at-best" team performance at home vs. the Bengals in which they still had a chance to win the game. If the same effort is displayed on Thursday, don't count on getting the "W" against the division-rival Steelers who are coming off a putrid defensive effort against the Brian Hoyer-led, Josh Gordon-less Browns @ home. Since divisions were a "thing" in the NFL, only 5 teams have opened the season 0-2, at home, against division opponents. Here are the Ravens keys to the game this Thursday to avoid being team #6.

				<li>
					<h4>Run. Run. Run. </h4>
					
					<p>
Recognize that the Steelers couldn't stop Ben Tate and Terrance West on the ground, and employee the same attack with Pierce, Forsett, and Taliaferro. Note: the Browns employee a zone-blocking scheme that is nearly identical to the Ravens and the Steelers didn't have a clue how to stop it last week. Why change anything? The Goal: Control time of possession 35 min - 25 min and rack up 175+ rushing yards, 1 TD. 
					</p>
					
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Get after Big Ben early and often.</h4>
					
					<p>
The Ravens had ZERO sacks of Dalton last week and rarely ever made him move his feet. When playing at home, with "dominant" pass rushers such as Suggs and Dumervil, you must alter the way the Steelers want to run their offense. While it isn't necessary to send 5+ players after the QB every play, more production needs to be had from the base 4 rushers each play (typically some combo of Suggs, Dumervil, Ngata, Canty, Williams, McPhee, Tyson). The Goal: 3 sacks + 3 more QB knock-downs of Ben.
					</p>
					
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Once run game is established, expose the Steelers secondary.</h4>
					
					<p>
You may not realize it yet, but this Steelers defense is BAD. If the Ravens don't hang 24+ points on them @ home, it's time to start worrying about our new offense.  Torrey Smith should run circles around a washed-up Ike Taylor. Troy Polamalu isn't a spring-chicken anymore, either. The Goal: Torrey Smith 100+ Rec Yards, 1 TD. 
					</p>
					
				</li>

				<h3><u>Final Thoughts/Predictions</u></h3>
				
				<p>
If the Ravens don't come out completely un-prepared and flat (due to off the field distractions) I expect them to win this one. Going 0-2 at home, vs the division to start the season is a tough hole to be in. Also expecting a higher-scoring affair that a normal Ravens/Steelers battle: Ravens 30, Steelers 24. (Vegas Line: Ravens by 2.5 pts).
