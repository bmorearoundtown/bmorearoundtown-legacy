This one is intriguing... perhaps way more than any Ravens/Browns matchup in recent years. Both teams are coming off impressive wins at home vs. quality opponents. Both teams have a chance to assert themselves as a threat to the Bengals. The loser of the game on Sunday will have a tough climb from the basement of the AFC North. For being such an early-season game, this game holds a lot of weight. Here are the things to watch for Sunday:

		<h4><u>Week 3: Ravens(1-1) at Browns (1-1)</u></h4>

					<h4>Can the Ravens get Torrey Smith going? </h4>
					
					<p>
Through 2 games, the Ravens #1 WR has been invisible. He's totaled 4 catches for 60 yards. Pathetic. Kubiak's offense is known for producing HUGE numbers for the beneficiary "X" receiver (see: Andre Johnson). Something tells me Kubiak gives Torrey multiple chances to make a play down the field this week against a Browns team he fared well against last year. 21 targets for 160 yards over 2 games. Get ready Joe Hayden...

					<h4>Have a day, D-Line! </h4>
					
					<p>
Nobody on the Ravens roster has a sack that is not named Elvis Dumervil. Don't expect Suggs to finally fill up the stat sheet this Sunday. He'll be working against big Joe Thomas who is one of the best LT's in the league. Ngata/Canty will be put to the test against a Browns team looking to pound the rock. Brandon Williams is out, so these two will play a lot of snaps. All of a sudden the Ravens are painfully thin up front. They could get gassed if the Browns have early success on the ground.
 </p>

				<li>
					<h4>Take advantage of Cleveland's lack of playmakers. </h4>
					
					<p>
Cleveland's top play-maker is a hobbled Jordan Cameron. Other than that, they have Miles "hamstring" Austin, and a bunch of possession receivers. Terrence West has looked good, but he is not really a home-run-hitter this early in his career. Meanwhile, the Ravens have a better offensive weapon at every offensive position across the board. No need to get cute, our offense is vastly better. Execute. </p>

				<h3><u>Final Thoughts/Predictions</u></h3>
				
				<p>
Vegas has the Ravens as 2 point favorites on the road, but I don't see this one being quiet that close. I expect the Ravens to open up their offense a little and the Browns simply won't be able to keep up. Final Score: Ravens 27, Browns 17.</p>
