			Far different from this time last year, the Ravens will NOT open the 2014 campaign as the defending World Champions. Since hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February 2012, the team has undergone a complete offensive and defensive facelift. That being said, there seems to be a lack of general consensus about how the Ravens will finish this season, leading to an exciting buzz of uncertainty around the city leading into Week 1.

		<h4><u>Week 1: Bengals (0-0) @ Ravens (0-0)</u></h4>

			Ravens host the defending AFC North champions in the first of 3 consecutive division battles (vs Bengals, vs Steelers, @Browns) that is likely to set the tone for the remainder of the season. Here are the "3 Game Changers" to watch for during this Week 1 showdown:

					<h4>Establishing a Running Game Under Gary Kubiak:</h4>
					
					<p>
					Coming off a dismal year being ranked dead last in the NFL in Yards-Per-Carry, this is item is on the top of my list. With Ray Rice suspended, the load will fall on Pierce, Taliaferro, and Forsett who led the NFL in rushing collectively during the pre-season. Stringing together a few 5-8 yard gains would be a pleasant surprise to fans who are so used to seeing Rice and Pierce struggle to squeak out 1-2 yards on 1st downs last year. Even better than setting up 2nd-and-short is the fact that establishing the run opens up what Kubiak is all about...Hard play-action passes that press the ball down the field. The goal: 150+ yards rushing, plus two 40+ yard pass plays.
					</p>
					
				</li>

					<h4>How Will The Secondary Hold Up:</h4>
					
					<p>
					Believe it or not, Andy Dalton threw the 3rd most touchdown passes in the NFL last year. Shocking, I know, but the Red Rocket (Dalton) has some real weapons at his disposal when under center. With Webb/Smith probably not at 100%, Elam taking on a new (albeit his natural) position, and Free Safety being a combination of newcomers (Stewart and Brooks), there is plenty to worry about with AJ Green coming to town. The goal: Bend, but don't Break in the secondary and hold Green to less than 125 yards receiving.
					</p>
					
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>The Pass Rush:</h4>
					
					<p>
					During large portions of games last year, you could easily forget that the Ravens own TWO all-pro Outside Linebackers (Suggs and Dumervil) that are counted on to dominate their end of the line of scrimmage and wreak havoc on the opposing QB. Ever heard the saying, "the best corner back and safety combination is two good defensive ends?" This couldn't be more true for the Ravens. If Suggs and Dumervil return to Pro-Bowl form, the press "in your face" style of Jimmy Smith and Matt Elam will be that much more effective with Dalton forced to get rid of the ball quickly. The goal: 2 sacks and 4 QB Hurries of Dalton (between Suggs and Dumervil).

				<h3><u>Final Thoughts/Predictions</u></h3>
				
				<p>
				Opening Day crowd at M&T Bank Stadium will be a difference-maker. Flacco will make less mistakes than Dalton. Ravens have the special teams advantage. Score: Ravens 27, Bengals 23. (Vegas Odds: Ravens by 2).
